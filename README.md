## 📋 About the Project

This project is aiming to solve a family problem: my father's client management.

#### 🛠 Current Situation

My father works as a handyman and gardener — he's basically a MacGyver type of guy. His current workflow goes like this:

A client contacts him by phone or WhatsApp;

They chat and agree on a price for the service;

My father does the job and gets paid.

#### ❌ The Problem

He doesn’t have any kind of customer history or management system. Most of the time, he ends up scrolling through old WhatsApp messages just to find the last price he charged for a service.

#### ✅ The Solution

To help him out, I decided to build a small customer management system. After talking to him about his needs, we came to an agreement and designed the main features, which are represented in the following Use Case Diagram.

The most important features to him with, to be responsive for mobile and have acess to the history of the client.
